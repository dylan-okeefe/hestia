## Test counts

| Stage | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Baseline (develop) | 620 passed, 6 skipped |
| After L26 commits | 637 passed, 6 skipped |

New tests added:
- `tests/unit/test_reflection_runner.py` — pattern mining, proposal generation, disabled skip, cap, markdown JSON extraction
- `tests/unit/test_proposal_lifecycle.py` — create/get, list by status, accept/reject/defer, prune expired, count, missing update
- `tests/integration/test_reflection_scheduler.py` — idle run, recent-activity skip, low-signal no-proposals
- `tests/integration/test_session_start_proposals.py` — first-turn injection, no injection on subsequent turns, no injection when no pending proposals

No test regressions. One pre-existing smoke test failure (`tests/smoke/test_phase_1b_integration.py::test_proto_orchestrator_uses_terminal_tool`) unrelated to this loop.
